                    <p>
                        At the bus stop a kid was clinging onto my leg asking me for money. I was kind of 
                        annoyed by him so I scolded him a little bit but what he said next made my heart drop.
                        His story was about how he was begging against his will and someone was taking money from him. He
                        asked me to buy him food so he would at least be able to eat something. I did
                        get him some food but as I walked away from him, I could see a lady in a sari coming 
                        up to him. She started screaming at him and then hitting him. Seeing this small child being abused made my heart swell.
                        This is when I was determined to do something to not only help this kid but also all the other kids getting abused and trafficked.

                    <p>
                    There are people who make fake promises to poor people in rural areas about how they will 
                    provide their children with good education and job. But they are sold to industries that are risky for even
                    a grown person to do. We aim to rescue these type of children from their poor living situations to provide them with a proper childhood.
